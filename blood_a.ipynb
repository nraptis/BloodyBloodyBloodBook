    "---Quick Summary of Cell Types\n",
    "\n",
    "Basophil: Basophils are rarely seen but, when increased, suggest myeloproliferative neoplasms,\n",
    "chronic inflammation, or hypersensitivity reactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Eosinophil: Eosinophilia most commonly points to allergic disease, parasitic infection,\n",
    "drug reactions, or certain hematologic malignancies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Erythroblast: Circulating erythroblasts indicate severe marrow stress such as hemolysis, hypoxia,\n",
    "marrow infiltration, or recovery after acute blood loss.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lymphocyte: Normal mature lymphocytes reflect routine immune surveillance, though increased\n",
    "numbers suggest viral infection or lymphoproliferative disorders.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lymphocyte (Atypical): Atypical lymphocytes are classically associated with viral infections\n",
    "such as EBV, CMV, or acute immune activation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Metamyelocyte: Presence of metamyelocytes indicates a left shift, typically due to infection,\n",
    "inflammation, marrow stress, or myeloproliferative disease.\n",
    "\n",
    "Monoblast: Monoblasts in peripheral blood are abnormal and strongly suggest acute myeloid\n",
    "leukemia with monocytic differentiation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Monocyte: Monocytosis is associated with chronic inflammation, infection, tissue repair,\n",
    "autoimmune disease, or certain myeloid neoplasms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Myeloblast: Circulating myeloblasts are pathologic and highly concerning for acute leukemia\n",
    "or advanced marrow infiltration.\n",
    "\n",
    "Myelocyte: Myelocytes in blood reflect significant marrow stimulation or dysregulation,\n",
    "commonly seen in severe infection or myeloproliferative disorders.\n",
    "\n",
    "Neutrophil (Band): Increased band neutrophils indicate an acute inflammatory response, often\n",
    "referred to as a “left shift” from infection or stress.\n",
    "\n",
    "Neutrophil (Segmented): Segmented neutrophils are normal mature granulocytes responsible for\n",
    "innate immune defense against bacterial pathogens.\n",
    "\n",
    "Promyelocyte: Promyelocytes in peripheral blood are abnormal and suggest acute leukemia\n",
    "or severe marrow stress, with particular concern for APL.\n",
    "\n",
    "Promyelocyte Bilobled: Bilobed promyelocytes are characteristic of acute promyelocytic leukemia\n",
    "and carry critical diagnostic and therapeutic implications.\n",

    "chronic lymphocytic leukemia."
